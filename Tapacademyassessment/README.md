# Employee Attendance System (Starter)

This repository scaffolds a full‑stack Employee Attendance System with a React client and an Express TypeScript server. It includes minimal auth, attendance check‑in/out flows, and sample data so you can start iterating quickly.

## Stack
- Client: Vite + React + TypeScript + Zustand + React Router
- Server: Node.js + Express + TypeScript

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies
   - `cd server && npm install`
   - `cd ../client && npm install`
2. Run the dev servers (server first)
   - `cd ../server && npm run dev`
   - `cd ../client && npm run dev`

## Env Variables
See `.env.example` in `server/` and `client/` for required variables.

## Notes
This starter uses in‑memory storage for users and attendance to keep the focus on UI/API flows. Swap to a real database (PostgreSQL/Prisma or MongoDB/Mongoose) as a follow‑up.
